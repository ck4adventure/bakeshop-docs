# Still Grinding on Specs

Most of my work the last couple days has been creating wireframes and updating specs as need to match. I also created a higher-level web routes overview to help inform just what pages I need to build. What seems to be just a few simple actions becomes quite a lot of pages and components to catch the details.

So far, for wireframes I have:

- template for wireframing with both web and mobile views
- v1 dropdown menu with all features linked
- inventory view page - empty
- item creation page
- inventory view page - with items
- item view page
- update production schedule modal
- production list index page
- production list item page

And now I understand why there are so many template projects out there to spin up basic signup/in pages or an ecommerce site. There really is so much repeatable code that once I get this initial project set up to how I like it, I should create my own template repository.
