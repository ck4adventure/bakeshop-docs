I've been up to a lot this last week but haven't been remembering to write it down. I spent some time learning how Nestjs implements authorized routes through their AuthGuard model. 

There was a also a short detour back to my original recipes app that gave me the practice I needed before starting this one. I want to get auth put on that as well so that I can feel comfortable having create/edit recipe forms on prod. That would allow me to share my favorite recipes with my ex and any other friends that enjoy food.

And another detour today looking up REDIS, REmote DIctionary Server, which I have not yet gotten to use in production. I hadn't really thought about all the capabilities it can provide but it makes so much sense to use the fastest possible solution for lookup when you don't need persistance. I look forward to setting one up for my b2b app once it gets complex enough to need it.

And today I used chatGPT for a refreshed on session storage vs jwt tokens. I can see where having stateless jwt's is considered an improvement over cookies and client side storage.  Definitely an area I feel rusty in. 

However, that led to an interesting question around what user actions and data I should be storing. It seems so obvious once I think about it, but there are a lot of different types of data that need to be stored around users and their actions.
