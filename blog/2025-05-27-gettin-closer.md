# Security and Tools
Added helmet and and enabled cors. Helmet sets basic security headers that are good practice. Cors for cross origin resource sharing since my front-end is hosted elsewhere.

Haven't had to think about web security for a while so this is a great refresher. Next is csrf and types of sessions.
