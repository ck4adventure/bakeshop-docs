# Small Digression into Backend Frameworks
Last week as I started down the path of setting up repos, the first thing I did was head over to the [Nest.js docs](https://docs.nestjs.com/), and start reading up on what it is as a framework and how to get started. Nest uses the dependency injection design pattern, which I must admit I have not used in any of my previous roles. So I took a little extra time across a few days to read up on it, understand the use of decorators for dependency injection and just getting to know decorators in general. I had chatgpt make me a [cheat sheet](blog/2025-05-12-modern-javascript-since-es6.md) to be able to review what was added when. Which, it turns out, comes from Typescript. 

Which reminds me that although I have a couple of books on Typescript that I've attempted to read through, neither really offered information structured in a way that I was easily able to process. So today I also asked chatgpt for a quick rundown on how typescript differs from js, and got [this list](2025-05-12-typescript-vs-javascript.md). It was a great reminder of how classes look in TS since so far I've only made simple react components and not done any class based work.
