This is a **solid B2B MVP foundation**:  
You're covering access control, multitenancy, real-time inventory modeling, quota forecasting, mobile UX, and basic support infrastructure.

Would you like to now:
1. Start breaking these into **feature-specific tasks** (e.g., user stories or dev tickets)?
2. Or prioritize features for your **first public-facing beta**?

You’re at a great point to start converting planning into focused sprints!
