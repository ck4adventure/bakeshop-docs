Your roadmap is **exceptionally well-structured**‚Äîa rare mix of thoughtful security, practical product steps, and scalable engineering design. That said, if you‚Äôre aiming for *best-in-class* practices and trustworthiness for B2B customers (especially handling food inventory), here are **10 specific, pro-level recommendations**:

---

### üîê **Security & Privacy Enhancements**

1. **Add OWASP ASVS or Top 10 checklist review**
   ‚ñ∏ Include a milestone to cross-check your app against [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/) (for app-level security) or the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) ‚Äî especially around broken access control, injection, etc.
   ‚úÖ *Phase 4: Auth & RBAC* is a great place for this.

2. **Implement per-bakery tenancy isolation strategy**
   ‚ñ∏ Explicitly define how multi-tenancy is enforced (e.g., per-bakery `organization_id` scoping on all queries).
   ‚ñ∏ Consider query middleware (e.g., with Prisma middleware or Nest interceptors) to enforce this globally.
   ‚úÖ *Phase 3 or Phase 5* could include this.

3. **Add audit logging for sensitive actions**
   ‚ñ∏ Track who did what and when (e.g., inventory edits, password resets, account invitations).
   ‚úÖ *Phase 4 or 5* is ideal.

4. **Evaluate whether you need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**
   ‚ñ∏ If bakeries upload PII or have EU clients, GDPR compliance could matter. Add a note to review legal basis and include a checkbox for data policy acceptance.

### üì¶ **Data Design & Integrity**

5. **Add support for soft versioning of schema/data**
   ‚ñ∏ If a bakery changes its daily quotas or a cookie is renamed, keep history to avoid corrupting past analytics.
   ‚ñ∏ Consider `valid_from` / `valid_to` timestamps or a change log table.

6. **Include rollback or manual override tools**
   ‚ñ∏ Add an admin-only feature to reverse a batch mistake (e.g., batch logged incorrectly). This builds trust in real-world ops.
   ‚úÖ Could be a feature flagged tool in *Phase 5 or 8*.

---

### üß™ **Testing & Validation**

7. **Add security regression tests**
   ‚ñ∏ After implementing features like login, RBAC, quotas, add automated tests that verify unauthorized users *cannot* access restricted endpoints.
   ‚úÖ Extend *Phase 6: Mobile Responsiveness & UX Polish* testing section.

8. **Validate time zone correctness**
   ‚ñ∏ Inventory and baking schedules are very time-dependent. Add a note to validate that your backend consistently stores timestamps in UTC and your frontend respects the bakery‚Äôs local time zone.
   ‚úÖ Add to *Phase 3 or Phase 5*.

### üöÄ **Operational Excellence**

9. **Schedule automated backups and retention policy**
   ‚ñ∏ PostgreSQL DB backups and restores should be verified in staging. Add an explicit step to test recovery before launch.
   ‚úÖ Could go in *Phase 7 or 10*.

10. **Add performance and load testing to pre-launch**
    ‚ñ∏ Use k6, Artillery, or JMeter to simulate real-world usage‚Äîimportant for B2B trust.
    ‚úÖ Add to *Phase 9: Pre-Launch*.

### ‚úÖ Summary

This checklist is already better than most SaaS startup plans. These additions will make your project *enterprise-grade* while preserving lean execution. If you'd like, I can generate a revised version with these folded in.

Would you like that?
