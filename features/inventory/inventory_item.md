## As a manager, I want to override the scheduled daily bake quota with a different number
Usually it is to bake less than the scheduled quota, but also sometimes more. This could be a holiday, general uptick in sales or better than expected sales in some way. This number cannot be changed by the manager once the baker marks it complete.

Needs UI description.
